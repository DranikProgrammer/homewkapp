# Homewkapp

HomeworkApp is a project for managing homework and reminders for a typical class. 

The server side is written in Java and using Spring boot, uses mysql

The client side is written JavaScript(ES6) using React as the main UI framework and Flux as a data management helper. React Material UI is used as a component and style base.

**This was my first project made with React and Spring.**
