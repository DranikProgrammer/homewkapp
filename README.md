# Homewkapp
HomeworkApp is a project for managing homework and reminders in a typical student form. 

## Dev
The server-side is written in Java using the Spring Boot framework (MVC, Security). It makes use of the gradle build system for easy deployment and mobility. Data storage is carried out by a MySQL server.

The client-side is written JavaScript(ES6) using React as the main UI framework and Flux as a data management helper. React Material UI is used as a component and style base. Final versions are compressed and bundled with webpack.

This was the first project I made with reactJS and Spring Boot. It works stable, though it has some architectural flaws. They can be fixed in a timely manner, but I decided to keep the project untouched except for important issues.
